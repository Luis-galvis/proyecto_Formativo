VIDEO DEMO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLDnWQFBn74
DESCRIPTION: BD Tech is a software solution developed for Bushido Dojo, a karate academy with branches in Ibagué, Colombia, and Panama. The application aims to streamline and optimize various processes within the dojo, including student registration, attendance tracking, payments, group creation, and rank assignments. Built using PHP, SQL, and JavaScript, this web application functions as a portal to improve the dojo's visibility and internal management.

Objectives:
The primary goal of BD Tech is to systematize Bushido Dojo’s operations by providing a more efficient and organized way to manage student data, such as payments, attendance, and ranking. By doing so, the project aims to:

Improve the organization of the dojo’s internal processes.
Offer better control over payments and attendance, ensuring no data is lost.
Expand the dojo’s reach, making it more accessible to potential students through a user-friendly online portal.
Provide a platform where members can track their children's attendance and basic information.
Features:
Announcements: Display relevant news and updates to students and staff.
Registration: Simplify the registration process for new students, allowing them to sign up and start training.
Payments: Facilitate the management of payments, ensuring they are securely recorded.
Login System: Secure login for users to access their profiles.
Group Creation: Organize students into groups based on their level and progress.
Rank Assignments: Keep track of students’ progress and assign new ranks as they advance.
Attendance Tracking: Log students' attendance to monitor their training consistency.
Equipment Management: Keep track of dojo equipment and gear for students.
Justification:
The existing system of managing students through Excel sheets was inefficient and prone to errors. This project was developed to provide a centralized web platform that not only stores student data but also optimizes various processes, such as attendance and payments. The software will help improve the dojo's internal management, making it easier for staff to handle administrative tasks and for students to access essential information. Additionally, the project will enhance the dojo’s visibility, allowing it to attract new students and expand its reach.

Benefits:
For the Dojo: This project will streamline internal processes, reduce administrative overhead, and improve overall organization. The dojo will also benefit from increased brand visibility and reach, attracting more students through the online portal.
For Students: Students will have easier access to important information such as class schedules, prices, available training plans, and their attendance records. Parents can also monitor their children's progress and attendance directly through the platform.
Impact:
The project will have a significant technological impact by improving the dojo's administrative processes, including the management of attendance, payments, student groups, and registration. The online portal will also serve to expand the dojo's brand and attract a broader audience to the practice of karate.

Technology Stack:
PHP for the backend logic and server-side operations.
SQL for managing the database and storing student information, payments, and attendance data.
JavaScript for client-side interactivity and dynamic content rendering.
Challenges:
During the development of this project, we faced challenges with integrating the database and ensuring that the payment system was secure and reliable. However, we overcame these challenges by researching best practices for web security and consulting documentation for the tools and frameworks used in the project.

Future Work:
In the future, we plan to add more advanced features such as:

Notifications: Alerts for students and staff about important events or updates.
Mobile App: A mobile version of the platform to allow users to manage their profiles on the go.
